# Data-Visualization with Tableau

<font size="+10">**1. Flight Delay**</font>

*Business problem*: Online travel agencies often want to evaluate and compare performance of the US major airlines so they can offer recommendation to users. This sort of data can be extracted from the U.S. Department of Transporation website but the data set is very large and thus difficult to see insights.

*Proposed solution*: Data visualization provides an accessible way to understand data, see trends and patterns. Tableau dashboard is the way to go.

<font size="+10">**2. Housing Affordability**</font>

*Business problem*: First-time homebuyers usually seek for real estate agentsâ€™ recommendation or advice. The data on the affordability of housing is always available but agents need to make big data like this one easier for clients to understand, compare and detect patterns.

*Proposed solution*: Data visualization with Tableau is a great tool to achieve this goal.
