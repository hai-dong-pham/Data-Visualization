# Data-Visualization with Tableau
Business problem: Online travel agencies often want to evaluate and compare performance of the US major airlines so they can offer recommendation to users. This sort of data can be extracted from the U.S. Department of Transporation website but the data set is very large and thus difficult to see insights.

Proposed solution: Data visualization provides an accessible way to understand data, see trends and patterns. Tableau dashboard is the way to go.
